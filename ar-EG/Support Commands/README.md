## 686 Utiliites: `/support` Commands
Support commands are **single-response** embeds used to quickly answer frequently asked questions or provide help.

‚ö†Ô∏èThese are *not* interactive guides. If you're looking to create multi-step walkthroughs, contribute to [`/guides`](https://github.com/686-Utilities/686-Utilities-Translations/tree/main/en-GB/Guides) instead.

## How it works:
Each command is stored in an XML file under the Support Commands directory and contains:<br>
A **name**, used as the command keyword.<br>
A **title**, used as the embed heading.<br>
A **description**, for main content (supports markdown).<br>

Optional:
- **Fields** for extra sections.
- **Buttons** for links (max 5). (Link is the only Style supported at the moment).
- **Color** in RGB format (R, G, B).

‚ÑπÔ∏èOnce live, users can trigger the command using: `/support [name]`.

## ü™Ñ How to Contribute
1. Fork this repository.
2. Navigate to the Support Commands folder.
3. Add a new .xml file ‚Äî the filename does not matter, but <Name> must be unique.

Each XML file must contain only one <Command> block.
